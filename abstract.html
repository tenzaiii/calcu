                <p>In the world of education, there's a significant and widespread problem â€“ a noticeable dislike and fear of mathematics among students. 
                    Recent research by Suleiman (2018)  has uncovered some concerning numbers, revealing that a remarkable 92.50% of students genuinely don't 
                    enjoy math. What's even more troubling is that 86.25% of these students feel an unwarranted fear, creating an ongoing cycle of anxiety that 
                    can negatively impact their academic journey. Nicolaidou, M, adds weight to this issue by emphasizing that this prolonged fear and anxiety 
                    around math can solidify into a deeply rooted negative attitude, potentially affecting students' future academic endeavors. Furthermore, 
                    The fear and apprehension associated with mathematical problem-solving often hinder academic progress and discourage students from pursuing 
                    STEM fields. To address this issue, we introduce InstaQ, an innovative product designed to empower students by providing instant guidance and 
                    solutions to mathematical problems. This product called "Instaq" serves as a guide for students, especially when they are struggling to solve
                    mathematical equations. Helping users solve numerical problems in various fields such as mathematics, engineering, finance, and science. 
                    By harnessing the power of artificial intelligence and modern technologies, InstaQ aims to create a supportive learning environment, fostering 
                    a positive attitude towards mathematics.Instaq is a product produced through intensive research and studies. From both qualitative and 
                    quantitative research such as evaluating data from interviews, surveys, product tests, and assessment of the product performance are conducted 
                    to ensure the efficacy and usability of this product for a wide range of users. Gaining insights from the perspectives of different users, 
                    market analysis, and product quality helped our company to produce a product that meets the demands of the people for a high-performing calculator, 
                    with both accuracy and precision in solving. The studies that were conducted reveal that this product has a transformative impact on the overall 
                    performance of users in various fields. Instaq was able to speed up decision-making in solving math problems and optimize efficiency at tasks 
                    whether in school or working fields. Due to its instant capability to solve problems in real-time, its customizable features that can be adjusted 
                    for different users, and its advanced learning assistance and system, all of those existing features have been the key drivers to the overall 
                    success of this product throughout the professional, teachers, students, and others. The significance of InstaQ lies in its potential to 
                    transform the way students approach and overcome mathematical challenges. By offering instant guidance and solutions without the need for 
                    internet connectivity, InstaQ becomes an invaluable companion in classrooms, libraries, and study sessions. This tool not only aids struggling 
                    students but also encourages a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts, laying the groundwork for future academic success in STEM disciplines. 
                    InstaQ not only addresses the fear of mathematics but also contributes to closing the educational gap by providing a resource that is accessible 
                    to students regardless of their internet connectivity. The integration of AI technology and a built-in camera makes mathematics more approachable 
                    and enjoyable, fostering a positive learning environment for students of all levels.
